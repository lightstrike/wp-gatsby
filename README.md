WP Gatsby
====

This plugin makes using WordPress and GatsbyJS much more seamless. Current features:

* live preview of post updates on a Gatsby development server `gatsby develop`
* updating view, preview and visit site links to use the domain Gatsby is deployed on
* adding a preview REST API endpoint to enable Gatsby preview functionality
* auto-publishing to Netlify when posts and pages are updated (using web hooks), along with ad-hoc ability to create a new build


## Installation Instructions

**TODO** Add.


## Disclaimer

Before v1.0 no promises of stability. Use at your own risk =)
